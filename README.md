# PuttingOutFires

The first game I've ever made with Unity basically poking fun at what I do all day at work. Completed most of it over a single weekend so it's pretty terrible, but it was fun to make and I learned a lot about Unity and C# in general. 

I decided to use WebGL in order to make it available online. I also made a leaderboard using Google Apps Script that receives high scores as a post request from the game, stores it in a Google Sheet, and then displays it on the site using an iFrame. I encrypted all of the network requests to/from the game to discourage cheaters from faking high scores, but I imagine someone could manage it. I would honestly love to see someone do it. If you manage, please let me know how you did it.
